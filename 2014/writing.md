Intro: Just write! (2 min)
----------------------------------

Something to note throughout the majority of this session: just barf it
out, and edit it later. The focus for this should not be perfection, but just flow. Shush your inner critic.

This session will be a timed dictatorship to get you to write,
write, write.


Step 1: Pick a Topic & Outline (8 min)
-----------------------------------------

You have a list of 20 topics to write or speak about - choose one!
*Choose a few if you can't narrow it down*

Suggestions on what to write about
- reflections on the learning process, 
- bugs you’ve come across and how you’ve fixed them, 
- tutorials on lesser-known languages and technologies,
- updates on your progress on your coding projects. 
- “Every time you spend more than five minutes fixing a bug, you should write about it" -Debra Williams Cauley at WSC 2013 ([more](http://www.writespeakcode.com/blog/2013/11/16/so-you-wanna-write-tech-books.html))

Step 2: Get Feedback (10 min)
-----------------------------------------

Get in a pair and discuss your choosen topics or the few you are
considering.  Help each other flesh out the idea.

Spend 5 mins on each person's work.

Step 3: Write (15 min)
-----------------------------------------

Start writing your blog post or article. Just do it!

Step 4: Get Feedback (10 min)
-----------------------------------------

Get in a *different* pair and discuss your choosen topics or the few you are
considering.  Help each other flesh out the idea.

Step 5: Write (15 min)
-----------------------------------------

Keep writing!

Step 6: Let's share our work! (5 min)
---------------------------------------------------

Go around and have each person say the topic they are writing
about and brief description.
