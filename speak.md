# Speak

What's a talk proposal?
-----------------------------------------

Talk proposals are short descriptions of a talk that are submitted to
conference or meetup organizers. Talk proposals are often submitted to a
CFP (Call For Proposals) put out by conference organizers.

Proposals typically consist of:
-   Title
    -   Get people interested and excited
    -   Be vague enough that you have wiggle room when creating your presentation
    -   Be specific enough that readers know what you’re talking about
-   Description (1-2 paragraphs)
    -   What’s the main idea? What are some sub­-topics? What’s the conclusion?
    -   What will the audience come away with?
    -   Some people include bullet points with a rough outline of the talk
    -   Keep people interested
    -   Be vague and specific :)
    -   Show the reviewer that your talk has substance
-   Outline
    - not required but helpful for both the speaker and reviewer


Need inspiration? 
* [Example Talk Proposals](https://github.com/WriteSpeakCode/2013curriculum/blob/master/speak/speak_day_guide_%2B_exercises.md#example-talk-proposals) from the WSC 2013 Handout
* Check out the descriptions of talks at any conference you attend - usually the published description IS the talk proposal
* Take a look at [Write/Speak/Code's 2016 talks](https://2016.writespeakcode.com/talks)

Write your talk proposal
-----------------------------------------

Consider doing the following:
* Intended Audience
* Outcomes/Conclusions
* Outline
* Description/Abstract
* Title

Take a look at [Rebecca's talk proposal repository](https://github.com/rmw/talks) and [her proposal template](https://github.com/rmw/talks/blob/master/template.md).

#### Help each other flesh out the idea.

Feedback to give when reviewing proposals:

1.  Do you understand what this talk is about?
2.  Does it have enough relevance to attendees? ("What's in it for me?")
3.  Will this talk fit in the time allotted?
4.  Has this person thought through all the points they want to make?
5.  Would you want to see this talk?
