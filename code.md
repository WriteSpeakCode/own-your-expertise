Where to find Open Source Projects
---------------------------------------------------------------

Tips for brainstorming potential projects:
- What projects do you use and would personally benefit from?
- Is there an issue you're passionate about?
- Contributions don't have to be *just* code. Many open source projects are sorely needing better documentation (think of all the libraries you've used that could benefit from more/clearer examples), tests, and design.
