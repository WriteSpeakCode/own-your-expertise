=================================

One hour is not a lot of time, and most likely we won't have time to actually contribute to a project today. But we can at least start the process, by finding a project that both interests you and is beginner-friendly, then setting it up on your local machine.

Intro: Where to find Open Source Projects
---------------------------------------------------------------

Tips for brainstorming potential projects:
- What projects do you use and would personally benefit from?
- Is there an issue you're passionate about?
- Contributions don't have to be *just* code. Many open source projects are sorely needing better documentation (think of all the libraries you've used that could benefit from more/clearer examples), tests, and design.

Step 1: Find an Open Source Project to Contribute to (15 min)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Using your brainstorms on your values knowledge, and experience, research some projects you would be interested in contributing to.

1. Find 1-3 potential projects to contribute to
  1. _______________________
  2. _______________________
  3. _______________________
2. Share what you found on the etherpad.


Step 2: Check-in & Feedback (5 min)
---------------------------------------------------

Find a pair and share your research:
- where did you look to find projects?
- what types of projects did you try to find?
- how did you decide on a project?

Give each other suggestions on other projects or areas to look at.


Step 3: Assess the projects (15 mins)
---------------------------------------------------
Facilitator will bring up a few projects from the etherpad and look at their Github pages.

What to look for:
- good documentation on how to contribute, including how to setup and run
- good test coverage (so you know you don’t break shit)
- a community (google group, IRC, forum etc)
- labelled issues
- positive communication in pull requests

Step 4: Find 1-2 issues that you could attempt (15 min)
---------------------------------------------------

*New to git? Go through this tutorial instead <http://try.github.com/>*

Step 4: Setup the project, start on the issue if time (35 min)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fork the project, clone it to your laptop, and then set up the project. This will most likely take up some time.

If you finish setting up your project environment, go ahead and start working on your open source contribution!

Step 5: Check-in & Feedback (5 min)
-----------------------
Go around the room and have each person say:
- project and issue they choose
- what you were able to get done and/or what you'd like to get done in
the next month
- thoughts on finding projects and issues and project setup

What to do after today?
-----------------------
- Work on the issue, then submit a pull request. *There may be some back and forth - don't get discouraged!*
- Seek out a mentor if you need help submitting a pull request (a mailing list, a meetup office hours, us!)
- Make some public projects for yourself
- Blog/tweet about it!
- Go to open source socials. Know of an upcoming event? Share it on the
etherpad.
