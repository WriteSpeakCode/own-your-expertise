Intro: What's a talk proposal (5 min)
-----------------------------------------

Talk proposals are short descriptions of a talk that are submitted to
conference or meetup organizers. Talk proposals are often submitted to a
CFP (Call For Proposals) put out by conference organizers.

Proposals typically consist of:
-   Title
    -   Get people interested and excited
    -   Be vague enough that you have wiggle room when creating your presentation
    -   Be specific enough that readers know what you’re talking about
-   Description
    -   What’s the main idea? What are some sub­-topics? What’s the conclusion?
    -   What will the audience come away with?
    -   Some people include bullet points with a rough outline of the talk
    -   Keep people interested
    -   Be vague and specific :)
    -   Show the reviewer that your talk has substance
-   Outline
    - not required but helpful for both the speaker and reviewer

Here are some [Example Talk Proposals](https://github.com/WriteSpeakCode/2013curriculum/blob/master/speak/speak_day_guide_%2B_exercises.md#example-talk-proposals) from the WSC 2013 Handout


Step 1: Pick a Topic & Get Feedback (10 min)
-----------------------------------------

You have a list of 20 topics to write or speak about - choose one!

Get in a pair and discuss your choosen topics or the few you are
considering.  Help each other flesh out the idea.


Step 2: Write a Talk Proposal (10 min)
-----------------------------------------

Write your proposal!

We recommend you start with an outline of what you'd like to discuss,
then write the description (1-2 paragraphs) and then the title.


Step 3: Feedback (10 min)
--------------------------------------
Get into small groups (2-4), read each talk proposal and get/give feedback. Adjust proposals as needed.
*Rotate pairs so you get feedback from as many people as possible*

Feedback to give when reviewing proposals:

1.  Do you understand what this talk is about?
2.  Does it have enough relevance to attendees? ("What's in it for me?")
3.  Will this talk fit in the time allotted?
4.  Has this person thought through all the points they want to make?
5.  Would you want to see this talk?


Step 4: Adjust Proposal (10 min)
--------------------------------------
Based on the feedback you've gotten, adjust your proposal.

Step 5: Find Opportunities to Speak (10 min)
--------------------------------------------
Find opportunites to speak that would fit with your

1. 1-2 big conferences - also include the call for proposal CPF deadline, if easily findable.

-   Where do your leaders in your industry/community speak?


Step 6: Let's share our work! (10 min)
--------------------------------------

Let's take this time to share what we did with each other.

Go around the room and each person should say their topic, description
of proposal, and conferences or meetups they found.

What do I do after today?
--------------------------------------
-   Finish and submit your proposal *(you may or may not get a proposal accepted on the first try - don't get discouraged! If at first you don't succeed, try try again :) )*
-   Find opportunities to practice
    -   your friends, coworkers, in front of your mirror, record then watch yourself
    -   reach out to meetups
