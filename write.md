# Write

Get Writing!
---------------------------------------------------

Something to note throughout the majority of this session: just barf it
out, and edit it later. The focus for this should not be perfection, but just flow. Shush your inner critic.

Suggestions on what to write about
* reflections on the learning process, 
* bugs you’ve come across and how you’ve fixed them, 
* tutorials on lesser-known languages and technologies,
* updates on your progress on your coding projects. 
* “Every time you spend more than five minutes fixing a bug, you should write about it" -Debra Williams Cauley at WSC 2013 ([more](http://www.writespeakcode.com/blog/2013/11/16/so-you-wanna-write-tech-books.html))
* Julia Evan's round up [topics to write and speak about](https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/03/06/1-1-topic-ideas/)

Where to submit or publish?
